Pull
$ git pull origin master
git pull, in contrast, is used with a different goal in mind: to update your current HEAD branch with the latest changes from the remote server. This means that pull not only downloads new data; it also directly integrates it into your current working copy files. This has a couple of consequences:

Since "git pull" tries to merge remote changes with your local ones, a so-called "merge conflict" can occur. Check out our in-depth tutorial on How to deal with merge conflicts for more information.
Like for many other actions, it's highly recommended to start a "git pull" only with a clean working copy. This means that you should not have any uncommitted local changes before you pull. Use Git's Stash feature to save your local changes temporarily.
